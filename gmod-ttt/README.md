ttt_mk_bunker
-------------

My first map in forever.  Just playing with some of the items and events
in TTT, and remembering how to lay out a map.

Six largeish interconnected rooms, should be enough space for an alright
game as long as there aren't too many people.


ttt_mk_squares
--------------

An experiment: a bunch of cube rooms, each with its own style and theme,
connected by glitches in the matrix.

I have no idea if there's any flow or rhythm to this map.  Probably not
much.  But you can't see from room to room, so there's plenty of
opportunity for shenanigans if you can split everybody up.


ttt_mk_flufy
------------

Started out as a proof-of-concept, recreating a scene from pictures.
I added enough things (including an entire underground zone) to
hopefully make it playable, but it was never designed for gameplay.


ttt_mk_whiteout
---------------

A snowy map, with a large open middle and some fiddly bits around the
edges.  Experimenting with the usual TTT tropes: a tester, a traitor
room, various traps and secrets.
