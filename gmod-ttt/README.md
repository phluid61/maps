ttt_mk_bunker
-------------

My first map in forever.  Just playing with some of the items and events
in TTT, and remembering how to lay out a map.

Six largeish interconnected rooms; should be enough space for an alright
game as long as there aren't too many people.

ttt_mk_squares
--------------

An experiment: a bunch of cubes, each with its own style and theme,
connected to each other by *glitches in the matrix*.

I have no idea if there's any flow or rhythm to this map -- probably not
much -- but you can't see from cube to cube, so there's plenty of
opportunity for shenanigans if you can split everybody up.


ttt_mk_trenches
---------------

It's war.  Defend your entrenchments from the combine.  But watch out,
there are traitors in your midst...


ttt_mk_flufy
------------

Started out as a proof-of-concept, recreating a scene from pictures.
I added enough things (including an entire underground zone) to
hopefully make it playable, but it was never designed for gameplay.


ttt_mk_wasteland
----------------

A small map with only a few traitor options.  This one has a proper 3D
skybox, and includes AI node paths to make any spawned NPCs that little
bit more effective.

ttt_mk_weird_stuff
------------------

Just like it says on the box.  Experimenting with features like
displacements, and different clipping surfaces, and people in the
skybox.  Probably sniper heaven.


ttt_mk_whiteout
---------------

A snowy map, with a large open middle and some fiddly bits around the
edges.  Experimenting with the usual TTT tropes: a tester, a traitor
room, various traps and secrets.

ttt_mk_e1m1[_tex]
-----------------

An homage to the classic `e1m1` map from the original 1996 game Quake.
Includes versions with and without real textures.
